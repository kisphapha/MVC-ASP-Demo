# MVC-ASP-Demo

<p>TThis project is made by me as the first milestone on the road to conquering ASP.NET </p>
<p>The web application is a simplified version of an e-commerce app yet still has all the necessary functions in order to operate properly. The features include login, register and:
<ul>
  <li>User: View products, search products, add to cart, purchase, view profile, update profile, view orders history</li>
  <li>Admin/Staff: CRUD products, Approve/update orders</li>
</ul>
<p>The web application is developed using .NET 6. To run the application, clone the repository, open MVCDemo.sln on Visual Studio and click Run. Have fun!</p>
